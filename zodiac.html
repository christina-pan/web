      <p> David Fincher's sixth feature film--the investigative psychological thriller Zodiac--is a
        adaptation of the investigation of the Zodiac killer that ravaged the San Francisco Bay Area in the 70s. 
        Equally terrifying is the Zodiac's unspeakable crimes and their flirtation with
        the San Francisco Globe newspaper; as so much is the obsession across decades of select individuals and institution 
        failure brought upon the criminal justice system, and the lingering knowledge today that justice has not been served; the perpetrator behind these
        murders has never been fully identified. </p>
