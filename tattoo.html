      <p> David Fincher's ninth feature film is based off Stieg Larrson's posthumous novel under the synonymous name.  
       We follow Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced financial journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, the punk-haired, tattooed computer hacker,
        as they investigate the 40-year-old murder of Harriet Vanger, the niece of the wealthy Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger. 
        Vangerâ€™s family is old, filthy rich, and rife with secrets. Salander's character study is equally compelling as Fincher 
        catapults between a riot grrrl aesthetic and the juxtaposition of trauma, abuse, power, and control. There's a permafrost to every
        scene in a film, with an ending that just about can keep you cold for a long while. </p>
