    <h3> Se7en</h3>
          <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/74/1b/26/741b26d5487b1d3c800c5fe6d9413bc7.png" height="500px">
      <p> David Fincher's second feature film--the gritty psychological thriller Se7en--
        is set place in a nondescript city as two detectives, Somerset and Mills, 
        solve crimes of a serial killer who bases his crimes off the seven deadly sins. 
        Woefully nihilistic and sinister in both its masterful cinematography and characterization, 
        Se7en has become sort of a cult classic over the years. It's simultaneously terrifying and 
        absolutely thrilling--all the more astonishing considering the online onscreen murder is done by a cop. 
        The iconic line of "What's in the box" will likely stay in your head (HA!) for a very long time. </p>
        
    <h3> Zodiac</h3>
          <img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-89dUE2rcQEU/WA-MopSuuOI/AAAAAAAAYLE/-hV1O5ho44gN3T9W_a50RrYBMH-HgV_VwCLcB/s1600/zodiac%2Bposter.jpg" height="500px">
      <p> David Fincher's sixth feature film--the investigative psychological thriller Zodiac--is a
        adaptation of the investigation of the Zodiac killer that ravaged the San Francisco Bay Area in the 70s. 
        Equally terrifying is the Zodiac's unspeakable crimes and their flirtation with
        the San Francisco Globe newspaper; as so much is the obsession across decades of select individuals and institution 
        failure brought upon the criminal justice system, and the lingering knowledge today that justice has not been served; the perpetrator behind these
        murders has never been fully identified. </p>
          
        <h3>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</h3>
           <img src="https://pm1.narvii.com/7031/5e1f13dd2e207f29a2f1bcde311e1f5fac5113e6r1-960-1440v2_hq.jpg" height="500px">

      <p> David Fincher's ninth feature film is based off Stieg Larrson's posthumous novel under the synonymous name.  
       We follow Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced financial journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, the punk-haired, tattooed computer hacker,
        as they investigate the 40-year-old murder of Harriet Vanger, the niece of the wealthy Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger. 
        Vanger’s family is old, filthy rich, and rife with secrets. Salander's character study is equally compelling as Fincher 
        catapults between a riot grrrl aesthetic and the juxtaposition of trauma, abuse, power, and control. There's a permafrost to every
        scene in a film, with an ending that just about can keep you cold for a long while. </p>
        
    <h3> Gone Girl</h3>
          <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0MDQ3MzAzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzU1NzE3MjE@._V1_UY1200_CR92,0,630,1200_AL_.jpg" height="500px">
      <p>David Fincher's tenth feature film is based off Gillian Flynn's bestelling novel under the synonymous name. 
        We follow the ongoing investigation of the missing Amy Elliot Dunne, and we follow her husband, Nick Dunne; through it all we 
        uncover a deeper, endlessly sinister underbelly of a couple's relationship 
        and the twisted psychosis of both individuals through a larger critique of mass media, a patriarchal society, and perhaps most irreverently, the "Cool Girl." </p>
        
        <h3> Blade Runner 2049</h3>
                    <img src="https://resizing.flixster.com/JSQhj07oIhsYdTaPu6iZ_ldKJa8=/ems.ZW1zLXByZC1hc3NldHMvbW92aWVzL2RlNzI0MGQyLTQ2ZTktNGMyYi05N2VmLTFjMDhiY2VlMDQ2Ni53ZWJw" height="500px">

        <p> Denis Villeneuve's 2017 sequel to Ridley Scott's original 1982 Blade Runner is nothing sort of a masterpiece. Villeneueve's distinctive flirations with 
          the brink of morality, existenialism, and futurism are done brilliantly; Han Zimmer's score is tremendously beautiful. The crux of it, however, is the
          stills—it would be possible to pause each second of the film and frame it. Villeneuve has created one of the most memorable and visually astonishing films of 
          the decade.
          
          <h3> Prisoners </h3>
                    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NTIzMjQ1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc3MzM5OQ@@._V1_.jpg" height="500px">

          <p> Denis Villeneuve's 2013 psychological thriller Prisoners is almost like a ringing glockenspiel—once you start, the reverberations come closer, louder, and slowly
          unstoppable. Prisoners follows the investigation of two missing six-year-old girls, each from different families, as their parents go to increasing lengths with their
          own morality to find them—all the while juxtaposed by the investigation of Detective Loki, a nails-hard, undefined-sort-of engima as the interconnected forces go about
          in an anxiety-riddled maze to find their daughters—or in the process, the depths of what they become—in time to break free.
