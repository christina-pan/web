<h2> Synposes </h2>
    <h4> Se7en</h4>
      <p> David Fincher's second feature film--the gritty psychological thriller Se7en--
        is set place in a nondescript city as two detectives, Somerset and Mills, 
        solve crimes of a serial killer who bases his crimes off the seven deadly sins. 
        Woefully nihilistic and sinister in both its masterful cinematography and characterization, 
        Se7en has become sort of a cult classic over the years. It's simultaneously terrifying and 
        absolutely thrilling--all the more astounding considering the online onscreen murder is done by a cop. 
        The iconic line of "What's in the box" will likely stay in your head (HA!) for a very long time. </p>
        
    <h4> Zodiac</h4>
      <p> David Fincher's sixth feature film--the investigative psychological thriller Zodiac--is a
dramatization of the investigation of the Zodiac killer. Equally terrifying is the Zodiac's unspeakable crimes and their flirtation with
the San Francisco Globe newspaper; as so much is the obsession across decades of select individuals and institution 
  failure brought upon the criminal justice system, and the lingering knowledge today that the perpetrator behind these
murders has never been fully identified. </p>
          
        <h4>The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo</h4>
      <p> David Fincher's ninth feature film is based off Stieg Larrson's posthumous novel under the synonymous name.  
       We follow Mikael Blomkvist, a disgraced financial journalist, and Lisbeth Salander, the punk-haired, tattooed hacker,
        as they investigate the 40-year-old murder of Harriet Vanger, the niece of the wealthy Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger. 
        Vangerâ€™s family is old, filthy rich, and rife with secrets. Salander's character study is equally compelling as Fincher 
        catapults between a riot grrrl aesthetic and the juxtaposition of trauma, abuse, power, and control. There's a permafrost to every
        scene in a film, with an ending that just about can keep you cold for a long while. </p>
        
    <h4> Gone Girl</h4>
      <p>David Fincher's tenth feature film is based off Gillian Flynn's bestelling novel under the synonymous name. 
We follow the ongoing investigation of the missing Amy Elliot Dunne, and we follow her husband, Nick Dunne; through it all we 
        uncover a deeper, endlessly sinister underbelly of a couple's relationship 
and the twisted psychosis of both individuals through a larger critique of mass media, a patriarchal society, and perhaps most irreverently, the "Cool Girl." </p>
