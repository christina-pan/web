          <p> Denis Villeneuve's 2013 psychological thriller Prisoners is almost like a ringing glockenspiel—once you start, the reverberations come closer, louder, and slowly
          unstoppable. Prisoners follows the investigation of two missing six-year-old girls, each from different families, as their parents go to increasing lengths with their
          own morality to find them—all the while juxtaposed by the investigation of Detective Loki, a nails-hard, undefined-sort-of engima as the interconnected forces go about
          in an anxiety-riddled maze to find their daughters—or in the process, the depths of what they become—in time to break free.
