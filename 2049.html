        <p> Denis Villeneuve's 2017 sequel to Ridley Scott's original 1982 Blade Runner is nothing sort of a masterpiece. Villeneueve's distinctive flirations with 
          the brink of morality, existenialism, and futurism are done brilliantly; Han Zimmer's score is tremendously beautiful. The crux of it, however, is the
          stillsâ€”it would be possible to pause each second of the film and frame it. Villeneuve has created one of the most memorable and visually astonishing films of 
          the decade.
