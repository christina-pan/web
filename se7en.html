      <p> David Fincher's second feature film--the gritty psychological thriller Se7en--
        is set place in a nondescript city as two detectives, Somerset and Mills, 
        solve crimes of a serial killer who bases his crimes off the seven deadly sins. 
        Woefully nihilistic and sinister in both its masterful cinematography and characterization, 
        Se7en has become sort of a cult classic over the years. It's simultaneously terrifying and 
        absolutely thrilling--all the more astonishing considering the online onscreen murder is done by a cop. 
        The iconic line of "What's in the box" will likely stay in your head (HA!) for a very long time. </p>
